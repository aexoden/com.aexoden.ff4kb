After save and reset for the grind fight, the encounter formation and step count tie together. Count the number of steps you take until the first battle then follow the instructions for this step count. The 2 stair tiles don't increment your step count.

If you get searcher + beamers and the notes say nothing about your encounter count then it is guaranteed to be horseman.
