After getting FuSoYa, save/reset on the tile where you parked the whale. After the cutscene, count the number of steps you take in the giant until the first encounter. Stairs and teleports don't count. Remember your step count then count the number of encounters you get until the save room.

In case the instruction says save/reset, follow this file:
