# ff4kb.aexoden.com

This is the source code to the ff4kb.aexoden.com web site. As long as I am maintaining the site myself, there is only
limited utility to this code. Nonetheless, this provides a backup in case I stop maintaining the web site for any
reason.

## Usage

This site is currently deployed using a ![dokku](https://dokku.com/) instance. The exact steps to configure the instance
to accept the code are not currently listed here, but it should not be too difficult for an experienced developer to
figure out. (Eventually, I intend to do some serious work on either rewriting or refactoring this code, so spending a
lot of effort on the existing structure is not ideal.)
